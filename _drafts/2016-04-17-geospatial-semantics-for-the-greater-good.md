title: Geospatial Semantics for the greater good

Now here is something of a presumptious title. But I'm serious here. The reason why some of us are so enthousiastic about geospatial technology, and some of us about semantic web technology, is their ability to help us with stuff that is hard to work with, but highly pertinent to our well-being. I'm not saying that geospatial semantics is the only way to address questions of health and happiness, but I'm convinced that they can play an enormously prominent role and that it provides a clear perspective on working transparently with 'smart data'. 

# Smart data
There is, of couse, no such thing as smart data. Data is only as smart as the technology it leverages to enable its smartness. This is where the geospatial and the semantic come into view: they allow resources to be compared to each other in terms of space; and semantics: it allows resources to be reasoned about in terms of their related meaning, if expressed in a way that allows machines to reason about them.

The second observation that I think is necessary to be stated is that, beyond human interest, there is no machine that can determine the smartness of data inferred. Data is simply of no interest to machines so the amount of smartness can only expressed by humans evaluating the value.

# Value through interaction
Most often, things do not represent value because they are there, but because we can interact with them. A car only has value if it can take us places. We should be able to move a chair, send a message to someone through a smartphone, or simply cross a street. I believe the same applies for data. It is of use because we can apply it on the spot, or somewhere else. It should be live, and portable.

Perhaps the easiest way of interacting with data is not to make calculations or infer new knowledge from it, it is simply through making simple observations from it. We may be able to 'like' a post, or add a message to our favorites. We express our appreciation through such simple means. For data, we should also be able to make observations about its validity for us. Often this kind of interaction is referred to as 'crowdsourcing'. OpenStreetMap and Google maps both allow people to make corrections to supposed faults or omissions, which are evaluated by administrators.
