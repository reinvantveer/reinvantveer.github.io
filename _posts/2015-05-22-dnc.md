# The Differentiable Neural Computer
Following the publishing of the [Nature article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/full/nature20101.html), we investigate the code behind it, found on the [dnc GitHub repo](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc). And use the information on [their blog](https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/).

To remember the potential power of recurrent neural networks, I dig up the article by Andrej Karpathy and in particular the section on [hallucinated Linux kernel code](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/#linux-source-code).

# Questions:
- What is the significance of the 'train.py' output?

- The 'train' program uses 10 randomly generated sequences. How and where are these sequences injected in the code?

- How can we make the model ingest data other than the training example?

- How can we feed it an RDF graph?
