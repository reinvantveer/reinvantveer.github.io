# Generic crowdsourcing API part 2: Linked Data provenance

History of the document can be inspected [here](https://github.com/reinvantveer/reinvantveer.github.io/commits/master/_posts/2016-05-27-a-generic-crowdsourcing-API-part-2.md)

From part 1, I established a few working hypotheses regarding crowdsourcing data:

- You can't just switch one source record by an altered crowdsourced version. You need to record its history.
- Classical database tables are probably not the best solution. 
- You can save the record history, nested in the document itself, by using, for example JSON.
- By using Linked Data, you can distinguish between the original document fields, and the provenance of alterations.

I'm still writing this post, but to prevent dead links, I'm already including it here.
