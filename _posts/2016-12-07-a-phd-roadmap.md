title: A PhD Roadmap for my first year as a researcher
layout: default

After a brief conversation with my supervisor, we agreed on having a roadmap for the first year. It's too far ahead to be looking into the full four years of development, but it's a good idea to at least plan ahead for the coming year.

Only recently I settled on a research outline that I will post soon as well. It will focus on a parallelized approach on transforming and enriching semi-structured data in a great number of csv files, in a wide range of table schemas. The target format will be JSON-LD, enabling semantic search on potentially a wide range of RDF or JSON storage solutions.

(More on the roadmap to follow soon)
