## On how AI can be of use to artists

The word "model" has to be one of the most overloaded terms in the history of human language. An abstraction or 
physical thing, tangible or ephemeral, something that stands for something else but can be something of itself at the 
same time. In this article I will combine "models" of both kinds, from the artistic domain and the "artificial 
intelligence" domain, although I try to shy away from this presumptious term, I'd rather opt for "machine learning" in
most cases.

### Art models

The artistic context: a model (in the stricter sense) is usually a person. Someone offering to pose for artists such a
sculptors or painters. The model acts as a reference for the artist to draw or sculpt a work of art. There is, of
course, something weird about this. The "model" in this case, the actual thing. The artwork could be more aptly
described as a model for the real thing, rather than the other way round!

### Machine learning models

Machine learning models usually _are_ proxies for a real (or an imagined) world domain. "Classic" domain examples, in as
far as anything in a field so young can be called as such, are models for
the ["MNIST" handwritten digit recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or
the ["ILSVRC" image recognition challenge](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/). These datasets have played a
significant role in shaping machine learning history. The "models" in the machine learning case, are pieces of software
that are able to perform some task or other: recognizing digits, or classifying images.

## Models generating models

Machine learning and art share a great deal of shared interest. There are numerous examples of cases where machine 
learning has been used to generate or emulate art, often with great success.

In my [previous post](/2022/01/29/easier-operator.html) I used a generative model to generate images from text to
include in my article. This was more something of a gimmick, to spice up the article a bit and to play around. But it
sparked my interest again in using generative models for artistic purposes. Especially since I started sharing an 
atelier with seven other art painters.
